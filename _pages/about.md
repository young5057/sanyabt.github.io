My name is Yang Wang, and I am a Ph.D. student of information science at University of Pittsburgh. I am currently being advised by Dr. Hassan A. Karimi in [Geoinformatics Laboratory](http://gis.sis.pitt.edu). My research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. My research interests include Deep Learning, Geoinformatics, Disaster Management, and GIS.

My previous research is about hydrology and water resources, especially hydrological forecasting under climate change. Information technology have been in my previous research, and at the beginning I just used it as a powerful tool for my research. But as the research progressed, especially the education I received at Pitt over the past two year, I became more aware of the significance of the subject. I feel that Information Science is not only a tool for me to deal with problem of my major, but also a comprehensive and interesting science. So I decided to change my direction to Information Science and do more systematic and in-depth research.
