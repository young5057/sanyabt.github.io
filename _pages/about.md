I'm a PhD student in the [Intelligent Systems Program](https://www.isp.pitt.edu/ "ISP") at the University of Pittsburgh, where I previously got my Master's degree (2018-2020). I am currently working with my advisor, Dr. Richard Boyce, on discovery of associations to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease using machine learning, knowledge graphs and large-scale electronic health records. Our team of public health experts, informaticians and computer scientists is funded by the Pitt Momentum Teaming Award (2020).

My research interests include natural language processing, data science, machine learning and clinical informatics. My Master's thesis, titled 'Bayesian Network Models with Decision Tree Analysis for Management of Childhood Malaria in Malawi', was completed in April 2020 with Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, Dr. Gerald Douglas and Dr. Gregory Cooper at the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI).

I also worked as a research assistant at the [Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health (MTH)](https://www.crmth.pitt.edu/) at the School of Medicine from September 2018 to February 2020, where we focused on public health research on social media related to vaping, nicotine addiction, anti-vaccination and more.
