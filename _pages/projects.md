**Identifying Changes in Discourse on Mass-Shootings Using Reddit Comments, Class Project, 2019**  
`*`	Word vector and k-Means for clusting  
`*`	Decide what topic the cluster represents using word cloud and manual inspection  
`*`	Chi-squared Test identifies whether there is association between time and topic  
`*`	Case study of four shooting events based on different time windows  

**A Predictive Model for Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease to Kidney Failure, Class Project, 2019**  
`*`	Led group of 4 students  
`*`	analyzes the risks involved in the process of CKD reaching kidney failure by screening key predictive variables so as to establish the predictive model  
`*`	The result suggests that the value of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) of logit model turns out to be 0.92  

**Studies on Real-time Flood Forecasting based on Land-Atmosphere Coupling Model in Small Scale Watershed, 09/2015-06/2018**  
`*`	Determined the specific assimilation scheme according to the data quality and update frequency of the watershed  
`*`	Established the distributed hydrological model, coupled with the output rainfall on corresponding scale WRF model  
`*`	Screened out the optimal spatial scale of land-atmosphere coupling for the targeted watershed  
`*`	Introduced the real-time correction technology of hydrological forecasting in the coupled forecasting system to further amend the error of the WRF rainfall prediction products in the process of runoff conversion  

**Studies on Water Security Technology of Grain Ecology in Songhua River Basin, 06/2016-06/2018**  
`*`	Studied the eco-environmental water requirement of Songhua river basin and established the calculation model  
`*`	Analyzed the trend and competition of external water demand in Songhua river and built a scheme for water supply  
`*`	Deeply studied the optimal allocation model of water resources on the basis of food ecological security  

**Studies on the Utilization of Water Resources in the Yellow River and Murray-Darling Basin under the Changing Environmen, 06/2015-03/2016**  
`*`	Constructed the “Ecological-Hydrological-Economic” coupling model; set up the evaluation index system of the coordinated development of water resources and social economy and introduced the intelligent decision theory  
`*`	Adopted the optimization model on the basis of the initial allocation theory of agricultural water right and the agricultural water transfer  
`*`	Formed the water allocation and trading system based on water rights, learning from the successful experience of water resources management domestic and overseas  

**Deep learning study by myself:**  
Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification APP  
`*`	Creat a CNN to Classifly Dog Breeds from Scratch  
`*`	Creat a CNN to Classifly Dog Breeds using Transfer Learning  
Face Generation  
`*`	Pre-processing of CelebA dataset  
`*`	Train a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible  
TV Script Generation  
`*`	Implement pre-processing function of lookup table and tokenize punctuation  
`*`	Creat RNN to generate a new, ‘fake’ TV Script, based on patterns it recognizes in training data
